                What a fun adventure! My 15 year old enjoyed it almost as much as my kinder age relatives.
                <br/>
                The chapters are short enough for a new reader to chapter books to feel successful and the 
                content is fun enough to appeal to all ages.
                <br/>
                Warning: if you donâ€™t have small children to read this book to at bedtime, 
                it may induce the desire to share it with all of the youngsters in your life.

            <h2>About the Author</h2>
            <h2>____</h2>
            <p>
              Rebecca J. Carlson lives on the North Shore of Oahu with her husband, 
              two youngest sons, one rabbit, one turtle, two parakeets, a lovebird, 
              and over a thousand pounds of books (she knows because she had to ship 
              those books across the Pacific when she moved to Hawaii). When she isn't 
              reading or writing, you'll find her teaching college physics, hiking in 
              the Ko'olau mountains, or playing harp in her Celtic folk band. 
              <br/>
              When her son told her he wanted a story about a magic sword for his 9th 
              birthday, Rebecca J. Carlson wrote what became "Barley & Rye: The Adventure 
              of Lost Castle." With traditional fairy tale elements woven together into a 
              whole new adventure, the story of brave Barley and his clever brother Rye 
              will delight fairy tale lovers of all ages.
